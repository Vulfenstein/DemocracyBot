# Democracy Bot

Dictators are so overrated. Democracy bot takes away the power of the few and gives it back to the many. Somone acting up? Insulting your mom? 
Well now you have the power of the people, call a vote, kick their ass out!

Will need discord developer account, create bot with send/read messages and move members permissions.
Will need to create a gif folder in the root directory and modify which ones it sends on kick or no kick.
